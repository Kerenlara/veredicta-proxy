# Veredicta Proxy

*Veredicta Proxy* is a research framework for regulatory-grade accountability, traceability, and evidence binding in high-risk AI systems.

The project introduces a cryptographically anchored architecture for:
•⁠  ⁠regulatory notices,
•⁠  ⁠consent artifacts,
•⁠  ⁠decision snapshots,
•⁠  ⁠and compliance-relevant metadata,

with specific alignment to the *EU AI Act (high-risk systems)* and *GDPR accountability requirements*.

## Abstract

This work proposes a structured evidence-binding layer for artificial intelligence systems operating under high-risk regulatory regimes.  
The framework introduces cryptographic linkages between regulatory notices, system snapshots, and decision artifacts using Merkle-tree-based integrity guarantees.  

The objective is not to evaluate model performance, but to provide *verifiable accountability, **auditability, and **post-hoc regulatory inspection* without exposing proprietary models or personal data.

## Scope

•⁠  ⁠AI governance and accountability
•⁠  ⁠Regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, GDPR)
•⁠  ⁠Cryptographic integrity for audit trails
•⁠  ⁠High-risk AI systems
•⁠  ⁠Decision provenance and traceability
